# Sales Trend Analysis and Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting monthly sales data by applying comprehensive data science techniques, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and time series forecasting.

Using a dataset of **185,950 sales records**, the goal is to uncover sales trends and predict future sales with robust accuracy to support data-driven business decisions.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handled missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions using `pandas`.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Created new features such as Year, Month, Time Slot, Day Type (Weekend/Weekday), and Order Type for enhanced model input.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualized sales patterns by city, product, time of day, and day type using `matplotlib`.

- **Moving Averages**  
  Applied Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Cumulative Moving Average (CMA) for trend smoothing.

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  Implemented and validated Linear Regression and XGBoost regression models for sales prediction.

- **Time Series Forecasting**  
  Used ARIMA model to forecast monthly sales, complementing machine learning results.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Assessed models with metrics including RMSE and RÂ² to ensure accuracy.
